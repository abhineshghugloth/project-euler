# Three distinct points are plotted at random on a Cartesian plane, for which -1000 â‰¤ x, y â‰¤ 1000, such that a triangle is formed.
# 
# Consider the following two triangles:
# 
# A(-340,495), B(-153,-910), C(835,-947)
# 
# X(-175,41), Y(-421,-714), Z(574,-645)
# 
# It can be verified that triangle ABC contains the origin, whereas triangle XYZ does not.
# 
# Using triangles.txt (right click and 'Save Link/Target As...'), a 27K text file containing the co-ordinates of one thousand "random" triangles, find the number of triangles for which the interior contains the origin.
# 
# NOTE: The first two examples in the file represent the triangles in the example given above.

#every point inside the triangle is a convex combination of the vertices
#so we want to solve a system of 2 variables and 2 equations:
#t1(x1-x3)+t2(x2-x3)=-x3
#t1(y1-y3)+t2(y2-y3)=-y3
