# A positive integer with k (decimal) digits is called balanced if its first k/2 digits sum to the same value as its last k/2 digits, where x, pronounced ceiling of x, is the smallest integer  x, thus Ï€ = 4 and 5 = 5.
# 
# So, for example, all palindromes are balanced, as is 13722.
# 
# Let T(n) be the sum of all balanced numbers less than 10^n. 
# Thus: T(1) = 45, T(2) = 540 and T(5) = 334795890.
# 
# Find T(47) mod 3^15

#given a number A=a1a2...akbc1c2...ck with sum-difference t and two new digits x,y we can form the number
# xa1a2...akbc1c2...cky with sum-difference t+(x-y), whose value is 10A+x(10^{k+1})+y

#but what about numbers that start with 0? We don't allow them, but only in the last iteration of adding x and y
